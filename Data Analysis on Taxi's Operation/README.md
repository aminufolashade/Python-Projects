# [Project 3: Data-Analysis-on-Taxis-Operation](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Data%20Analysis%20on%20Taxi%20Services.ipynb)

## Dataset description:
The dataset contains information about pickup and drop-off dates including the number of passengers with distance covered. It also recorded the color of the taxis with different modes of payment mode used by different passengers. The purpose of this project is to display codes for the taxi’s operations using the project questions.

Data Source: Kaggle

## Project Questions:

1. Display Number of Rows and Columns in the taxi’s dataset
2. Plot the distribution for distance
3. Compute mean, median and standard deviation for distance variable
4. Compute the standard deviation for distance with the ddof parameter set to 1
5. Plot the distribution for fare variable
6. Compute mean, median and standard deviation for fare variable
7. Create a scatter plot of fare versus distance
8. Compute the correlation coefficient for the correlation between distance and fare
